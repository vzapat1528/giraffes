  <h1>Giraffes are Awesome!</h1>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe">giraffe</a> is a genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest ruminants. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. They usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>

  <p>Here are several interesting facts about giraffes:<p>

  <ul>
    <li>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet.</li>
    <li>They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.</li>
    <li>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water</li>
    <li>Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.</li>
    <li>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.</li>
    <li>The giraffe calf can stand up and walk after about an hour and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation.</li>
    <li>A giraffe’s spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same pattern.</li>
    <li>Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time.</li>
  </ul>
